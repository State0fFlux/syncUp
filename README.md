# SyncUp

SyncUp is a web application designed to help users connect with friends or meet new local people based on proximity, shared availability, and interests. The app promotes belonging, spontaneous connection, and personal growth.

## Modes

- **Friends Mode (“My Circle”):** Coordinate and hang out with people you already know.
- **Community Mode (“Discover”):** Meet new people nearby with shared interests and compatible schedules.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI:** Google Gemini API

## Getting Started

This is a scaffolded project. To run it, you would typically install dependencies and start the development server.

```bash
# This project is designed for an environment that handles dependencies.
# If running locally, you would need to set up a React environment.

# Set your Gemini API Key
export API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```
